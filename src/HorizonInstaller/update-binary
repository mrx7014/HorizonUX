#  Man I'm rollin' through the city, old school on them big boys
#  12 inch woofers in the trunk making big noise
#  Got the big toys (toys), dont make me have to flash
#  Let a hundred rounds go, you do a hundred yard dash
#  Back up in the hood where the rules dont shift
#  And the gangstas talk trills, sip purp and burn piff
#  You can call 5-0 and 5-0 might come
#  But by the time that they arrive all that dirt had been done
#  Now one things for certain, and two things for sure
#  Being poor is a disease, gotta hustle up a cure
#  Start with your head homie then use your hands
#  If you try it in reverse, you dont even have a chance
#  We worldwide worried with the hunger and the thirst
#  From the third world countries to the second and the first
#  It sounds like a verse but its more like a plan
#  Get your Robin Hood on, put some pressure on the man, tell it!
